# LSTM_Project.repo :
- This colab notebook contains a LSTM based RNN model for Text Prediction.
# What is LSTM in Deep learning : ?
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) capable of learning and remembering information over time.
- This makes it a powerful algorithm for tasks like natural language processing, speech identification, and time series forecasting.
# About Model :
- It is a Sequential model with Two LSTM layers of 150 inputs each.
- One Dense layer of 150 Neurons and SoftMax as an activation function.
- It also has an Embeddings layer for Converting input data into Vector numbers.
- This Embedding layer has Input length of 150 words ( Can be different for other datsets ).
